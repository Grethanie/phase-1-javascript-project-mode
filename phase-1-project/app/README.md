This app is designed to showcase a set of pokemon so that you can compare their stats and various other information clearly. Each pokemon team contains at most six pokemon, so I chose that number to display.

there are three functionalities:

1. Double click anywhere on the screen to toggle a light and dark theme
2. click the show/hide button to toggle the stats on the page for each pokemon
3. hover your mouse over the sprite of each pokemon and you'll see the 'shiny' variant.

for a functionality walkthrough here is a video link: https://studio.youtube.com/video/rcxp3rU8NgM/edit

Thank you to pokeAPI for suplying the open-source data for this project, and Wikimedia for the Pokemon logo.
